# Git / Github

## Strategy

For working with git, github flow strategy will be used. Github Flow involves working with master branch which will contain working, ready to deploy code. New features will be developed on feature branches which will be branched off master. After work on a specific feature branch is done code will be reviewed, tested and merged into master branch. After that feature branch will be deleted.

# How We Work

Jira is used as a project management tool, where things to do are listed in the form of issues. Every week there is an online meeting, where progress, issues and plan for the next sprint are discussed. Sprint duration is 2 weeks. Additionally other tools are also used to simplify work.
